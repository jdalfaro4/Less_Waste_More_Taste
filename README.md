## Description  

Have you ever had expiring ingredients that you need to use up before they go bad? Have you ever lost all creativity at the end of the day and need to know what you can make for dinner with what you have? Take that bag of spinach that you put off eating for too long and enter your ingredients into the Less Waste, More Taste search engine. A list of recipes will populate to inspire your next meal. 

This app follows the MVC paradigm, uses Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.
